AUSWeather

AUS Weather is the first free iPhone weather app developed specifically for Australian users. It was originally released in January 2009. It gets the data from the BOM (Bureau of Meteorology) Australia. It was developed mainly to learn more about iPhone OS programming (at that time, iPhone OS version 2.x).
